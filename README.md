# Sprint3
 IT Academy - FrontEnd React_Sprint3
 
Introduction
A company in the e-commerce sector has asked us for a web application that allows them to offer the purchase of their products through the internet.

You will be in charge of setting up an initial demo version of the application for the client: management of the shopping cart and the application of the promotions on the final price. You have 2 weeks to finish, which is how long this sprint lasts.
